This too, is an image of ourselves
This too, is an image of ourselves
walls that bleed money
Dusty streets lined with gold
Wave after wave, a babel sea
of dreamers on our shores. They build
our towers like cliffs, strong
against the sky. They build our homes
and our temples. In return
we lead them ot our gods. Some are
blessed.
Others learn to stretch a day's pay
for weeks, to be looked oddly upon
without flinching, to eat
without flinching, to eat
without flinching, to eat
with cracked hands.
