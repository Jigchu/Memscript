First they take all my money.
Then take me to JB in lorry
later go to Singapore in tour bus,
I hide in luggage hole with five others.
I scared. They just push us in like that
Now I know they crooks but too late.
I cannot go back they will kill me I owe so much.
I cannot pay back enough. Agent take my passport
then dump me on the streets of Tekka. I wash
dustbin I scrub dump I sleep sometimes I eat.
This all I got after working a
year. If only someone told me
the walls of Tekka
are not made of gold.
