This too, is an image of ourselves
walls that bleed money
Dusty streets lined with gold
Wave after wave, a babel sea
of dreamers on our shores. They build
our towers like cliffs, strong
against the sky. They build our homes
and our temples. In return
we lead them ot our gods. Some are
blessed.
Others learn to stretch a day's pay
for weeks, to be looked oddly upon
without flinching, to eat
with cracked hands.

First they take all my money.
THen take me to JB in lorry
later go to Singapore in tour bus.
I hide in luggage hole with five others
I scared. They just push us in like that
Now I know they crooks but too late
I cannot go back they wil kill me I ower so much
I cannot pay back enough. Agent take my passport
then dump me on the streets of Tekka. I wash
dustbin I scrub dump I sleep sometimes I eat.
This all I got after working a
year. If only someone told me
the wallks of Tekka
are not made of gold
